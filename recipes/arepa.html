        <h2>Traditional Venezuelan Arepas</h2>
        <p>It was at a New York City hole-in-the-wall eatery where I first fell in love with a stuffed white corn cake. 
            Halfway through my first <strong>arepa</strong>, one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, 
            and salty cheese, I vowed to learn how to make these at home. 
            It's a truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your <em>favorite fillings.</em> I went with some spicy pork and avocado, 
            but I made a version a few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2½ cups lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups pre-cooked white corn meal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir water and salt together in a bowl. 
                Gradually stir corn meal into water with your fingers until mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 8 golf ball-size balls and pat each one into a patty about 3/8-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until shimmering. 
                Working in batches, cook corn patties in hot oil until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes per side. 
                Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Slice halfway through each cake horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        </ol>
